                My name is Mitchell Heit. I'm an aspiring softwear developer. I am currently enrolled in the UCF
                coding bootcamp and expect to pass with flying colors. My old passion was working on high end
                cars. Even though I loved it, I knew I had so much more potential. I've always loved the
                technical side of things. As a child, I use to take things apart just to see how it would work. Then
                I stumbled accross coding and at that second I knew I found my purpose. What I was supposed to
                be doing, something that made me genuinely happy. Being able to go into a website, break it down and rebuild it
                is something I've always loved, so why not see it from the technical side of things.
                That's when I knew coding would consume my life but if it's something you enjoy does it really matter?
                Somethings I enjoy are hanging out with my two wonderful dogs and using hobby grade RC cars outside of coding of course.
